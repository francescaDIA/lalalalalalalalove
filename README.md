# lalalalalalalalove

Simply click around the leaves and let each fall, simulating time passing.
With each leaf dropping, more hearts are exposed. More love is revealed. 

This is a poem on hope, love and the future. 'lalalalalala love' is an extension of the song love by jhene aiko. I created a script to find all the words love in the song and replace them with words that mean love to me. Words such as peace, devotion, care, protection and more. On the image of the rose, there is an excerpt and interpretation of these new lyrics:

  Dedicated and Devotes
  Praying often staying open
  To more consideration
  To more peace
  To more care
  
Inspired by Hadestown & its playbill cover, Orpheus's lalalala motif and his quest to bring the world back in tune by singing the most beautigul song, this piece is meant to be a reminder that even as time passes, even when the petals fall and things get rough, we will continue to sing of love & be hopeful.
